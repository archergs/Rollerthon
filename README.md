# Rollerthon

Rollerthon is a simple game made in Unity. All you do is roll the ball through each course, and try not to die. The game is still in development, and I plan to add music and other things in the future.

# Code stuff used

I used mostly C#, with one JavaScript script to manage the jumping in Level 4 onwards. This game is an ongoing project, so check back daily for the latest version.

# Thanks

I would like to thank Google (the search engine, not the company itself) for letting me search for answers to my many questions. YouTube and the many people who create Unity tutorials, especially Brackeys. Idk why there is a thanks section. It is a shitty game anyway.

# Thanks for playing!

Constructive feedback is welcome!
